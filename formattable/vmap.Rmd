#### Description
This function is a vectorized version of switch, that is, for each element of input vector, switch is
evaluated and the results are combined.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
vmap(EXPR, ..., SIMPLIFY = TRUE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``EXPR``: an expression evaluated to be character or numeric vector/list.
* ``...``: The list of alternatives for each switch.
* ``SIMPLIFY``: TRUE to simplify the resulted list to vector, matrix or array if possible.

#### Examples
```{r}
x <- c("normal","normal","error","unknown","unknown")
vmap(x, normal = 0, error = -1, unknown = -2)
x <- c(1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2)
vmap(x, "type-A", "type-B")
``
