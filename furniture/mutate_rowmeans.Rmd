Get Row Means within a Pipe

#### Description

Does what rowMeans() does can be used one its own without dplyr::mutate() within a pipe.mutate_rowsums

#### Usage
<pre><code>
mutate_rowmeans(data, new_var, ..., na.rm = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``data``: the dataframe that contains the variables to get the row means from
* ``new_var``: the name of the new variable for which youâ€™ll put the row means in quotes
* ``...``: the variables (unquoted) to be included in the row means
* ``na.rm``: should the missing values be ignored? default is FALSE

```{r}
library(furniture)
library(tidyverse)

data <- data.frame(
  x = sample(c(1,2,3,4), 100, replace=TRUE),
  y = rnorm(100),
  z = rnorm(100)
  )

data2 <- data %>%
 mutate_rowmeans("y_z_mean", y, z))

data2 <- data %>%
 mutate_rowmeans("y_z_mean", y, z, na.rm=TRUE))
 

```
