# R Tutorial: The `furniture` Package

The `furniture` package is designed to *make quantitative research more comfortable*. It offers streamlined tools to help you:
- Create professional-looking descriptive tables
- Clean up messy or placeholder data
- Cross-tabulate categorical variables with chi-square tests

Let’s walk through its core tools.

## 1. Installing and Loading the Package

```r
install.packages("furniture")
library(furniture)
```

## 2. `table1()` – Generate Descriptive Summary Tables

This function creates publication-ready tables often used as **Table 1** in academic manuscripts, split by groups and including statistical tests.

### Example:

```r
data %>%
  table1(var1, var2, var3,
         splitby = ~groupvar,
         test = TRUE)
```

- `var1`, `var2`, `var3`: variables to summarize
- `splitby = ~groupvar`: stratifies summaries by a grouping variable
- `test = TRUE`: includes tests of association (e.g., chi-square or t-tests)

For a simplified summary output, use `simple_table1()`.

## 3. `tableF()` – Quick Frequency Tables

This is a lightweight function for inspecting frequencies of a single variable.

```r
data %>%
  tableF(var1)
```

Ideal for checking counts or proportions at a glance.

## 4. `washer()` – Clean Placeholder Values

This utility replaces specified placeholder values with either `NA` or a new value. Great for tidying survey data.

### Replace placeholder codes (e.g., 7, 8, 9) with `NA`:

```r
x <- washer(x, 7, 8, 9)
```

### Replace `NA` values with a specific number:

```r
x <- washer(x, is.na, value = 0)
```

## 5. `%xt%` – Cross-Tabulation with Chi-Square Test

A custom infix operator for categorical variables. It returns a cross-tabulated table with a p-value from a chi-square test.

```r
f1 %xt% f2
```

- Both `f1` and `f2` must be factors.
- Output includes counts and p-value for the test of independence.
