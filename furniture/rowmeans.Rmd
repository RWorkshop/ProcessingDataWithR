rowmeans
Get Row Means

#### Description

* Does what ``rowMeans()`` does but without having to cbind the variables. 
* Makes it easier to use with the tidyverse.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
rowmeans(..., na.rm = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``...``: the variables (unquoted) to be included in the row means.
* ``na.rm``: should the missing values be ignored? default is FALSE.

#### Value
the row means

#### Examples
```{r}
## Not run:
library(furniture)
library(tidyverse)
data <- data.frame(
x = sample(c(1,2,3,4), 100, replace=TRUE),
y = rnorm(100),
z = rnorm(100)
)
data2 <- data %>%
mutate(y_z_mean = rowmeans(y, z))
data2 <- data %>%
mutate(y_z_mean = rowmeans(y, z, na.rm=TRUE))
## End(Not run) 

```
