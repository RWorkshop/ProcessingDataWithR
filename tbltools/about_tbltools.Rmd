# R Tutorial: The `tbltools` Package

`tbltools` is a lightweight utility package that provides tools to enhance workflows involving tibbles—modern, tidyverse-style data frames. Developed by Michael W. Kearney, the package includes functions to simplify common tibble operations such as conversion, ordering, and frequency reporting.

## 1. Installation

Since the package is no longer maintained on CRAN, it’s best to install it directly from GitHub:

```r
# Requires the 'remotes' package
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mkearney/tbltools")
library(tbltools)
```

---

## 2. Key Functions

### `as_tbl()`: Convert to a Tibble
Converts various R objects into a tibble structure.

```r
as_tbl(mtcars)
```

This is similar to `as_tibble()` but may include internal tweaks for compatibility with other `tbltools` features.

---

### `tabsort()`: Sorted Frequency Table
Generates a frequency table sorted by count.

```r
tabsort(iris$Species)
```

Returns a tibble showing unique values and their frequencies, descending by count—useful for quick categorical summaries.

---

### `env_tbls()`: List Tibbles in Environment
Scans your environment for tibble-like objects.

```r
env_tbls()
```

This helps identify which objects in your workspace are tibbles, particularly when working with multiple datasets.

---

### `repos_front()` and `repos_back()`: Reorder Tibble Columns
These functions allow you to bring specific columns to the front or move them to the back of a tibble.

```r
repos_front(iris, Species)
repos_back(iris, Sepal.Width)
```

Useful for making datasets more readable or preparing for modeling by reordering key variables.

---

### `tidyselector()`: Column Selection Tool
A helper function that aids in tidy evaluation of column names across functions, especially inside custom wrappers.

```r
tidyselector(iris, starts_with("Sepal"))
```

Returns column names that match tidyselect logic.

| Function         | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `as_tbl()`        | Convert an object to a tibble               |
| `tabsort()`       | Frequency table sorted by count             |
| `env_tbls()`      | List tibble objects in the environment      |
| `repos_front()`   | Move columns to the front of a tibble       |
| `repos_back()`    | Move columns to the back                    |
| `tidyselector()`  | Dynamically select columns using tidyselect |

This package is ideal for users who appreciate the clarity and structure of tidyverse workflows but want lightweight helpers for repetitive tibble tasks.
