## Greg-package 

Regression Helper Functions

The **`Greg`** package in R is a toolkit designed to streamline regression modeling, especially for medical and epidemiological research. It offers a suite of helper functions that make it easier to build, interpret, and present regression models in a publication-ready format.

Here’s what it brings to the table:

- **Crude vs. Adjusted Estimates**: It can generate HTML tables comparing univariate (crude) and multivariate (adjusted) model estimates side by side—great for spotting confounding effects.
- **Forest Plots**: It includes functions to create forest plots of model estimates and confidence intervals, even allowing comparisons across multiple models.
- **Robust Covariance Support**: Integrates with the `sandwich` package to provide robust standard errors for linear models.
- **Non-linearity Detection**: Offers tools like `addNonLinearity()` to test and model non-linear relationships using splines.
- **Time-Splitting for Cox Models**: Includes a `timeSplitter()` function to handle non-proportional hazards in survival analysis by splitting time intervals.

It’s particularly well-suited for users of the `rms`, `Gmisc`, and `forestplot` packages, and is maintained by Max Gordon.

#### Description 

This R-package provides functions that primarily aimed at helping you work with regression models.
While much of the data presented by the standard regression output is useful and important - there is often a need for further simplification prior to publication. The methods implemented in this package are inspired by some of the top journals such as NEJM, BMJ, and other medical journals as this is my research field.

#### Output functions

* The package has function that automatically prints the crude unadjusted estimates of a function next to the adjusted estimates, a common practice for medical publications.
* The forestplot wrappers allows for easily displaying regression estimates, often convenient for models with a large number of variables. 
* There is also functionality that can help you comparing different models, e.g. subsets of patients or compare different regression types.

#### Time-splitter
When working with Cox regressions the proportional hazards can sometimes be violated. As the ``tt()`` approach doesn’t lend itself that well to big datasets I often rely on time-splitting the dataset and then using the start time as an interaction term. See the function ``timeSplitter()`` and the associated ``vignette("timeSplitter")``.

#### Other regression functions
In addition to these funciton the package has some extentions to linear regression where it extends the functionality by allowing for robust covariance matrices. by integrating the ’sandwich’-package for ``rms::ols()``.

#### Important notice

* This package has an extensive test-set for ensuring that everything behaves as expected. 
* Despite this I strongly urge you to check that the values make sense. 
* I commonly use the regression methods available in the ’rms’-package and in the ’stats’-package. 
* In addition I use the `coxph()` in many of my analyses and should also be safe. 
* Please send me a notice if you are using the package with some other regression models, especially if you have some tests verifying the functionality.
