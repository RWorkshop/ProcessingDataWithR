timeSplitter A function for splitting a time according to time periods

#### Description 

If we have a violation of the cox proprtional hazards assumption we need to split an individualâ€™s
followup time into several. See vignette("timeSplitter", package="Greg") for a detailed
description.
\n#### Usage\n<pre><code>\n
timeSplitter(data, by, time_var, event_var, event_start_status,
time_related_vars, time_offset)
Arguments
data The dataset that you want to split according to the time_var option.
by The time period that you want to split the dataset by. The size of the variable
must be in proportion to the the time_var. The by variable can also be a vector
for each time split, useful if the effect has large varyations over time.
time_var The name of the main time variable in the dataset. This variable must be a
numeric variable.
event_var The event variable
event_start_status
The start status of the event status, e.g. "Alive"
time_related_vars
A dataset often contains other variabels that you want to update during the split,
most commonly these are age or calendar time.
time_offset If you want to skip the initial years you can offset the entire dataset by setting
this variable. See detailed description below.

Details
Important note: The time variables must have the same time unit. I.e. function can not dedu if all
variables are in years or if one happens to be in days.
Value
data.frame with the split data. The starting time for each period is named Start_time and the
ending time is called Stop_time. Note that the resulting event_var will now contain the timesplitted
eventvar.
The time_offset - details
Both time_var and other variables will be adjusted by the time_offset, e.g. if we the time scale is in
years and we want to skip the first 4 years we set the time_offset = 4. In the outputted dataset
the smallest time_var will be 0. Note: 0 will not be included as we generally want to look at those
that survived the start date, e.g. if a patient dies on the 4-year mark we would not include him/her
in our study.
Examples
test_data <- data.frame(
id = 1:4,
time = c(4, 3.5, 1, 5),
event = c("alive", "censored", "dead", "dead"),
age = c(62.2, 55.3, 73.7, 46.3),
date = as.Date(
c("2003-01-01",
"2010-04-01",
"2013-09-20",
"2002-02-23"))
)
timeSplitter(test_data, .5,
time_var = "time",
time_related_vars = c("age", "date"),
event_var = "event")
