#### Arguments 

x A data frame to be rendered
number_of_entries
a numeric vector with the number of entries per page to show. If there is more
than one number given, the user will be able to show the number of rows per
page in the table.
width Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is NULL, which results in
intelligent automatic sizing based on the widget’s container.
height Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is NULL, which results in
intelligent automatic sizing based on the widget’s container.
elementId Use an explicit element ID for the widget (rather than an automatically generated
one). Useful if you have other JavaScript that needs to explicitly discover and
interact with a specific widget instance.
